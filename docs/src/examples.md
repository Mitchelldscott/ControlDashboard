# This project provides two main examples

## 1. Sinusoid Tuner

The sinusoid tuner example demonstrates how to generate, analyze, and adjust sinusoidal signals. It is useful for understanding signal processing concepts such as frequency, amplitude, and phase. You can use this example to experiment with tuning algorithms and visualize how changes affect the waveform.

## 2. Quadcopter Stability

The quadcopter stability example simulates the control and stabilization of a quadcopter. It showcases feedback control systems, sensor integration, and dynamic response to disturbances. This example helps you learn how controllers (like PID) maintain stable flight and respond to changes in the environment.
